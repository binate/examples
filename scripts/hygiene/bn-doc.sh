#!/bin/sh
# Usage: ./scripts/hygiene/bn-doc.sh
#
# Checks the tightened godoc rule from explorations/code-hygiene-check.md §5:
# every top-level `func`, `type`, `const` (or `const ( ... )` group), and
# `var` declaration in a .bn file needs a `// ...` doc comment immediately
# above. No "trivial" carve-out.
#
# Heuristic notes:
# - "Doc above" means the closest non-blank line above the declaration is a
#   `// ...` line. A blank line between the comment and the declaration is
#   tolerated (common with section banners).
# - Unlike .bni, sibling decls do NOT inherit the previous decl's doc — each
#   `.bn` decl needs its own doc comment. The previous doc context is reset
#   after every decl.
# - `_test.bn` files are skipped: test helpers and Test* functions are
#   conventionally self-documenting by name.
#
# Limitations (intentional, first approximation):
# - Section banners and comment-shaped lines count as docs (shape, not content).
# - Group members inside `const ( ... )` are not individually inspected.
#
# Exit code: 1 if any violations found, 0 otherwise.
